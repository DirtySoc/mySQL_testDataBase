mySQL_testDataBase is a Visual Basic program that is a general outline for how to SET, GET, and DELETE from any variant mySQL database 
that utilizes the .NET mySQL connector.

This github project was created as a "hello world" project for me to learn how to better use github and Visual Studio integration. If you 
find code that you think might help you please feel free to use it! All code here is offered with NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER!!!!! I am NOT 
responsible for anything that this code does on your system.

Thanks!
